	abstract = {Online social networks are now a popular way for users to connect, express themselves, and share content. Users in today's online social networks often post a profile, consisting of attributes like geographic location, interests, and schools attended. Such profile information is used on the sites as a basis for grouping users, for sharing content, and for suggesting users who may benefit from interaction. However, in practice, not all users provide these attributes. In this paper, we ask the question: given attributes for some fraction of the users in an online social network, can we infer the attributes of the remaining users? In other words, can the attributes of users, in combination with the social network graph, be used to predict the attributes of another user in the network? To answer this question, we gather fine-grained data from two social networks and try to infer user profile attributes. We find that users with common attributes are more likely to be friends and often form dense communities, and we propose a method of inferring user attributes that is inspired by previous approaches to detecting communities in social networks. Our results show that certain user attributes can be inferred with high accuracy when given information on as little as 20\% of the users.},

This paper compares observational data from mobile phones with standard self-report survey data. We find that the information from these two data sources is overlapping but distinct. For example, self-reports of physical proximity deviate from mobile phone records depending on the recency and salience of the interactions. We also demonstrate that it is possible to accurately infer 95\% of friendships based on the observational data alone, where friend dyads demonstrate distinctive temporal and spatial patterns in their physical proximity and calling patterns. These behavioral patterns, in turn, allow the prediction of individual-level outcomes such as job satisfaction.},

	abstract = {Location plays an essential role in our lives, bridging our online and offline worlds. This paper explores the interplay between people's location, interactions, and their social ties within a large real-world dataset. We present and evaluate Flap, a system that solves two intimately related tasks: link and location prediction in online social networks. For link prediction, Flap infers social ties by considering patterns in friendship formation, the content of people's messages, and user location. We show that while each component is a weak predictor of friendship alone, combining them results in a strong model, accurately identifying the majority of friendships. For location prediction, Flap implements a scalable probabilistic model of human mobility, where we treat users with known {GPS} positions as noisy sensors of the location of their friends. We explore supervised and unsupervised learning scenarios, and focus on the efficiency of both learning and inference. We evaluate Flap on a large sample of highly active users from two distinct geographical areas and show that it (1) reconstructs the entire friendship graph with high accuracy even when no edges are given; and (2) infers people's fine-grained location, even when they keep their data private and we can only access the location of their friends. Our models significantly outperform current comparable approaches to either task.},

Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known—a collaboration network and a food web—and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

	doi = {10.1109/SocialCom-PASSAT.2012.102},
	abstract = {As truly ubiquitous wearable computers, mobile phones are quickly becoming the primary source for social, behavioral, and environmental sensing and data collection. Today's smart phones are equipped with increasingly more sensors and accessible data types that enable the collection of literally dozens of signals regarding the phone, its user, and their environment. A great deal of research effort in academia and industry is put into mining this data for higher level sense-making, such as understanding user context, inferring social networks, learning individual features, and so on. In many cases this analysis work is the result of exploratory forays and trial-and-error. Adding to the challenge, the devices themselves are limited platforms, hence data collection campaign must be carefully designed in order to collect the signals in the appropriate frequency, avoiding the exhausting the the device's limited battery and processing power. Currently however, there is no structured methodology for the design of mobile data collection and analysis initiatives. In this work we investigate the properties of learning and inference of real world data collected via mobile phones over time. In particular, we analyze how the ability to predict individual parameters and social links is incrementally enhanced with the accumulation of additional data. To do so we use the Friends and Family dataset, containing rich data signals gathered from the smart phones of 140 adult members of an {MIT} based young-family residential community for over a year, and is one of the most comprehensive mobile phone datasets gathered in academia to date. We develop several models for predicting social and individual properties from sensed mobile phone data over time, including detection of life-partners, ethnicity, and whether a person is a student or not. Finally, we propose a method for predicting the maximal learning accuracy possible for the learning task at hand, based on an initial set of measure- ents. This has various practical implications, such as better design of mobile data collection campaigns, or evaluating of planned analysis strategies.},

	abstract = {Studies of community structure and evolution in large social networks require a fast and accurate algorithm for community detection. As the size of analyzed communities grows, complexity of the community detection algorithm needs to be kept close to linear. The Label Propagation Algorithm ({LPA}) has the benefits of nearly-linear running time and easy implementation, thus it forms a good basis for efficient community detection methods. In this paper, we propose new update rule and label propagation criterion in {LPA} to improve both its computational efficiency and the quality of communities that it detects. The speed is optimized by avoiding unnecessary updates performed by the original algorithm. This change reduces significantly (by order of magnitude for large networks) the number of iterations that the algorithm executes. We also evaluate our generalization of the {LPA} update rule that takes into account, with varying strength, connections to the neighborhood of a node considering a new label. Experiments on computer generated networks and a wide range of social networks show that our new rule improves the quality of the detected communities compared to those found by the original {LPA}. The benefit of considering positive neighborhood strength is pronounced especially on real-world networks containing sufficiently large fraction of nodes with high clustering coefficient.},
